# ECE 524 Optimization Final Project
I along with some of my brilliant teammates decided to have a student-dormitory distribution model.
Since every student is able to indicate their preferences for dormitory and roommate, our passion is to build up a better assignment system to get a better sense of the studentâ€™s preferences. This helps us find the best possible match for each student. The objective of our project is to rationalize the assignment and maximize their satisfaction based on certain constraints and rules, such as capacity of the halls, room availability, distance to the department buildings and the gender of students. The preference options for students also can be counted as a big factor including the most acceptable price, the floor level, and the canteen. In this model, we will consider how much weight a student will value each aspect of a dormitory. For convenience, the data of student's preference and dormitory attributes will be created randomly.
